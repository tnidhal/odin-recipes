    <h><strong><em>Description:</em></strong>
    <p> Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. </p>
    <p> The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food. Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven. </p>

    <h><strong><em>Ingredients :</em></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt  </li>
            <li> 1 cup water</li>
            <li> 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li> 1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li> ¼ cup flour for dusting </li> 
            <li> 2 cups pizza sauce</li>
            <li> 20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese </li>
            <li> 20 leaves fresh basil </li>
            <li> olive oil </li>
            <li> sea salt to taste </li>
        </ul>
     <h><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong>
                <ol>
                    <li> Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                    <li> Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li> Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
                    <li> Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
                    <li> Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
                    <li> Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
                    <li> Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
