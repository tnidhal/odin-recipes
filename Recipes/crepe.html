    <h><strong><em>Ingredients :</em></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li> ½ cup milk </li>
            <li> ½ cup water</li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon salt  </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted  </li>  
        </ul>
    
    </h>
    <h><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li> Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
